# Expense Tracker
----
A Simple Expense Tracker written in React Native as a form of practice. This is to accompany a course I'm taking to learn the more modern techniques of React Native.

I intend on using this knowledge to create other React Native Applications

The back end for this project will be Firebase, for the time being. This is just to have something different than what I typically have been using which is Supabase.
